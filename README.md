# Extract_table_from_image

### A project to extract tables from images typically involves the following steps:

1. Image pre-processing: The first step is to pre-process the images to improve the quality and make them suitable for table detection. This may involve techniques such as image enhancement, thresholding, and noise reduction.

2. Table detection: Once the images are pre-processed, the next step is to detect the tables in the images. This can be done using various computer vision techniques such as edge detection, contour detection, and template matching.

3. Table structure analysis: After the table is detected, the next step is to analyze the structure of the table. This involves identifying the rows, columns, and cells of the table, and determining the relationships between them.

4. Text recognition: Once the table structure is identified, the next step is to extract the text from the cells of the table. This can be done using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques.

5. Data cleaning and organization: The extracted text needs to be cleaned and organized into a structured format, such as a CSV or Excel file.


### The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that can detect and extract tables from images, and organize the extracted data into a structured format that can be easily analyzed and used in various applications.
